# TYPO3 Extension Typo3 Mautic Form

This TYPO3 extension integrates Mautic forms into TYPO3 installations. <br>
Compatible with TYPO3 v12 (version 1.x), it allows editors to create a content element called Mautic Form. <br>
By specifying a Mautic Form ID and the Mautic Server URL, the content element renders the corresponding Mautic form directly within TYPO3 pages.

## Quickstart


### Install

If your TYPO3 instance is running in composer mode, you can simply require the extension by running:

- `composer require leuchtfeuer/typo3-mautic-form`


### After Installing

- Make sure to apply the database schema changes in the Maintenance module.
- TypoScript inclusion is not required.
